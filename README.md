### Simplify and game-ify playing music

#### Purpose: provide a learning framework for aspiring musicians. 
---
### How?
- Prompt user to complete a task (string of notes)
- Listen for audio input
- Judge competion of the task (integrate audio analysis tool)

---
### Early design
- prompt for one note
- allow the user to self validate completion (just a "done" button)
---
### Future goals:
1. Create levels of increasing complexity
    - This will create a sense of progression, which should be tuned to feel achievable. We don't want beginners to have access to tasks with a complexity level that will overwhelm them.
    - reach out to musician friends for advice on how to tune
2. Experiment with audio analysis tools to integrate into the app 
    - I to have the ability to judge success with a tuner
    - This should be an opt in feature, the app should be useable without a mic
    - Might need extra work to allow support for vocals.
